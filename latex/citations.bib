  abstract = {he InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) is a peer-to-peer
distributed file system that seeks to connect all comput-
ing devices with the same system of files. In some ways,
IPFS is similar to the Web, but IPFS could be seen as a
single BitTorrent swarm, exchanging objects within one Git
repository. In other words, IPFS provides a high through-
put content-addressed block storage model, with content-
addressed hyper links. This forms a generalized Merkle
DAG, a data structure upon which one can build versioned
file systems, blockchains, and even a Permanent Web. IPFS
combines a distributed hashtable, an incentivized block ex-
change, and a self-certifying namespace. IPFS has no single
point of failure, and nodes do not need to trust each other.},
